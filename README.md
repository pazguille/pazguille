### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

I'm a proactive and creative front-end developer. I keep a close eye on front-end development, web standards and web performance.

I’m currently leading the Front End Architecture Team who builds the Mercado Libre's platform for building universal applications with React and Node.js. So, I work closely with our front end engineers and UI designers to make sure our web applications are built consistently across the whole company.
